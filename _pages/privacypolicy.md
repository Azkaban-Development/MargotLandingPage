## 6. Data Retention

We store all collected data on the cloud for as long as you have an active account to provide you access to the features of Margot. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will delete your data. You may also request the deletion of your personal information through the application, where data is deleted immediately.
